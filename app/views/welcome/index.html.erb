<h1>Kamas Snow</h1>
<p><font size="5" color="green"> Jacob is more fun than Savannah. I really love to play football, basketball, baseball, and a little bit of soccer.  If you bring any type of ball I will play with you if I can. I am a good sport so, I won't tackle you if you win. :D I will love playing with you. Come to Kamas Snow and not just eat a snow cone but Play Ball! I will always try my hardest to get out of work for a couple of minutes to play with you. You can bring your friends to have a big game.</p>

<p><font size="3" color="brown"> Savannah is a hard worker. She does NOT give up, and always tries to do what she can for others. She absolutely DIES for purple and likes to rollerblade around the house. She will make sure your orders are neat and you get great quality. She loves to draw and make money, so come to Kamas Snow at anytime to meet with me - about money - or drawing! Everyone will smile when they have our fresh cones! Our prices are cheap... and when was the last time you've seen a snow cone shack in Kamas? Never! So come enjoy some cold in the hot! We always, and I mean ALWAYS do our best to make our costumers satisfied. The only reason you shouldn't be satisfied is because you don't have enough friends to bring to our shack! Our flavors are amazing and we are always accepting new friends to try them out. I like to smile and accept the challenges in life to make me a greater person.</p>
